# BSC Yieldfarming Dashboard

![Screenshot](./content/screenshot.png)

## Made with ❤️ from scratch for Binance Hackathon: The Future is now

I created the BSC Yieldfarming Dashboard because I was missing a better overview of the active yieldfarms on the Binance Smart Chain. Coinmarketcap is already providing a nice interface but it's missing a history feature where it shows the past APYs and also it does not update live.

The dashboard has a lot features which I also listed below. It was my first project in the crypto world and I really enjoyed making it!
